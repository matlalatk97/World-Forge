Compare Oculus OVRHand controlled finger tracking with VG OVRHand controlled finger tracking.
Mainly to see that they behave the same in terms of finger tracking quality.
VG controlled OVRHand does not integrate well with Oculus OVRHand because they run in different update loops.

NOTE: Oculus integration needs to be installed.
